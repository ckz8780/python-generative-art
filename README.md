# Python Generative Art

This repo encompasses some experimental stuff for creating/working with digital art. This is commonly used in the NFT space in order to generate NFT collections, but Python can do all kinds of things with images...image processing, machine learning, image identification AI, etc. Feel free to peruse the code, fork it, use it for reference or whatever else you desire. If you'd be so kind, please try to credit me with a [linkback](https://www.github.com/ckz8780/) if you happen to find anything here to be helpful/interesting and end up using it in one of your projects.
